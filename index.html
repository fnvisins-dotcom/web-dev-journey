    <h1>From Divine Texts to Digital Code: My Unexpected Path</h1>
    <section>
    <h2> My Background</h2>
    <h3>Years in Sacred Study</h3>
    <p>For five semesters, I immersed myself in Islamic theology. My days were filled with ancient texts, philosophical debates, and understanding the deeper meanings of faith. I learned to analyze complex arguments, respect diverse perspectives, and communicate profound ideas clearly.</p>
    <P>But something was missing. I loved the learning, yet I felt a pull toward creating something tangible—something that could reach millions instantly.

    <h2>The Turning Point</h2>
    <h3>The AI Revolution Changed Everything</h3>
    <p>When ChatGPT launched, I saw the future. AI wasn't replacing humans—it was amplifying those who understood how to wield it. I realized theology gave me critical thinking, but tech would give me impact.</p>
    <p>I made a decision: 6 months to become a full-stack developer. No looking back.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Critical thinking from theology</li>
        <li>Ethical foundation for AI development</li>
        <li>Hunger to build real solutions</li>
    </ul>
